                    Do you need someone who can help you install a new roof in Darwin? Depending on the type of roof you have, it will generally last between 20 and 50 years. When the time comes for a new roof, though, you shouldn’t delay action. Replacing your roof can give your home a fresh look, stop leaks and water damage and even lower your monthly bills.

                                Take advantage of our cool roofs: We named our business ‘Cool Roof Restoration’ because we install legitimately cool roofs. For those who want to go all out, want the best and are willing to spend for their roof fitting, we offer the perfect solution. By using top-end products on the market, such as Aircell roof insulation we achieve an extra layer of insulation for your home. This is done by spraying a new roof with the Cool Roof heat reflective paint to expand the lifespan of the roof. It also acts as an extra layer of insulation and therefore can lower the interior temperature even more by cutting the roof temperature in about half and improves the thermal performance of your home. By doing this we achieve even better results by adding some roof ventilators ( whirly Birds). When your roof isn’t soaking up the sunshine, your house stays cooler. And when your house stays cooler, you spend less on air conditioning.

                                    Properly installed and cared for, most metal roofs have the potential to outlast most other types of roofing. That doesn’t mean they’ll last forever, though, and in an environment like ours, corrosion on older roofs can sometimes be a problem. Watching out for patches of wear and keeping the roof free of debris can help to avoid any larger problems further down the road.
                                </li>

                                    While metal roofs are often billed as relatively maintenance-free, some things do merit a look every now and again. The screws that hold everything fast in place are one such item — but that’s quite a lot of screws! Don’t worry: Cool Roof Restoration checks each of them for tightness and replaces loose screws for no added charge.

                                    Metal roofing offers an excellent opportunity to achieve energy savings because painting is simple. Consider exploring what benefits you could reap from this process.

                            The Best Advice You Can Hear Regarding Roof Ridge Cap Repair in Darwin 
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Ridge caps are specially designed toppers for your roof and come in different formats depending upon your roof type. Their function is to create a seal at the ridgeline to direct rainwater down the roof slope and away from your attic space.

                                    Roof ridge cap repair in Darwin involves a complete inspection of your roof for leaks and loose materials. Large birds or plant life damage the materials causing them to become defective and create leaks.

                                    Damaged materials reduce the effectiveness of keeping water out of your home which can cause damage to the interior. Roof ridge cap repair in Darwin ensures that the peak of your roof is protected and prevents water from seeping under shingles, tiles or metal, keeping the inside of your home dry.
